## Installation

1. Pull from Github.
2. Enter `pip install flask`
3. Enter `pip install flask_restful`
4. Enter `set FLASK_APP=budget.py`

## Running the App

Run program with `flask run`. Find the `budget.py` file and open it.

## Notes to the Grader
The program runs fine. There are some issues with it. Adding a new category and a new purchase works. Deleting a category works too, but you have to refresh it in order to see the changes and it glitches with the amount spent.
